#### Architecture

In the past I heard a lot of the "Clean Architecture" pattern by Uncle Bob and I thought it would be a good idea to test this pattern in your coding challenge.
I had to make some changes throughout the data flow to implement this pattern into JavaScript. But I think it is possible and can be used in the future. Yey!
