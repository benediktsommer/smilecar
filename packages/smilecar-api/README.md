#### Architecture

The "Clean Architecture" pattern by Uncle Bob intrigued me for quite some time. Therefore, I thought it would be a good opportunity to test this pattern in your coding challenge.
I had to make some changes throughout the data flow to implement this pattern into JavaScript. Still, I think it is possible to use this pattern in the future. Yay!
