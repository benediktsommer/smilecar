# smilecar
This repository is based on the Happycar coding challange. I chosed the frontend part and added a backend to finally have the opportunity to try out a monorepo.
What exactly does that mean? In this project I tried to build a monorepo with Typescript, React, Express and Infersify...
It will be funny. Have fun looking through it
