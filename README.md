# smilecar
This repository is based on the Happycar coding challange. From the given challanges I chose to complete the frontend task including some backend elements.
This provided me with the opportunity to try a monorepo. Therefore, in this project I build a repository including the UI and API part written in Typescript, React, Express and Infersify...

## Development

1. Run `yarn start`
